# Technify: Note-Taking and Video Conferencing App

Technify is a versatile Android application that seamlessly combines note-taking functionality with video conferencing capabilities. This project embraces modern Android development practices, incorporating MVVM architecture, HILT for dependency injection, Coroutines for asynchronous programming, and Retrofit for efficient API integration. The app is designed to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience, featuring robust authentication handling, efficient validation, and a complete signup/login flow.

## Features

### 1. MVVM Setup
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. This ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase scalable and easy to understand.

### 2. HILT Dependency Injection
HILT is employed for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting code readability. This allows for easier testing, maintenance, and extension of the app.

### 3. Coroutines for Asynchronous Programming
Coroutines are used to handle asynchronous operations, enhancing the app's responsiveness. This enables smooth execution of tasks such as API calls and data processing without blocking the main thread.

### 4. API Integration with Retrofit
Retrofit is utilized for seamless integration with external APIs. The app leverages Retrofit to communicate with the Jitsi Meet API, facilitating video conferencing functionalities. Custom interceptors are implemented to manage authenticated flows, ensuring secure and efficient communication.

### 5. Jitsi Meet API Integration
The app incorporates the Jitsi Meet API, allowing users to engage in video conferences with remarkable scalability. With the capability to handle up to 70-80 participants simultaneously, Technify offers a robust and reliable video conferencing experience.

### 6. Authentication Handling
The app includes a comprehensive authentication system, securing user data and interactions. Custom interceptors and authentication flows are implemented to guarantee the integrity of user sessions and protect sensitive information.

### 7. Validation and Loading State Management
Efficient validation mechanisms are employed to enhance the user experience by preventing errors and guiding users through the app seamlessly. Loading states are managed gracefully, ensuring users are informed about ongoing processes without disruption.

### 8. Complete Signup/Login Flow
Technify provides a seamless and secure signup/login flow, guiding users through the authentication process effortlessly. This includes user-friendly interfaces for account creation, login, and password recovery.
